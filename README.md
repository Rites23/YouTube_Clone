# YouTube UI Clone

This is a basic YouTube UI clone built with HTML and CSS, designed to resemble the YouTube homepage layout. It features a header with a search bar 🔍, video categories on the sidebar 📂, and a grid displaying recommended videos 🎬. The page is responsive 📱💻 and showcases the use of material icons, Flexbox for layout, and a clean, organized structure for easy navigation. The project aims to replicate the core elements of YouTube's UI for practice with front-end development and layout design. 🚀
